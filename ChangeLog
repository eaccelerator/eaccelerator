	* Avoid invalid opcode 153/1/8 by not setting op2 to unused for
          ZEND_DECLARE_LAMBDA_FUNCTION.

2012-08-16  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Remove current memory protection implementation. This code has
	  been dead for a while now
	* Re-enabled some EQUAL/NOT_EQUAL optimisations in the optimizer
	* Removed duplicate macro CONSTANT() and rewrote all its occurances
	  to OPx_CONST
	* Removed old code related to BRK/CONT handling
	* Some cosmetic fixes to optimize.c

2012-08-13  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Fixed CONCAT/ADD_STRING + ADD_CHAR optimizer bug
	* Removed unused var in reassign_registers

2012-08-10  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Small tweaks to the disassembler:
	  - Display zval properly ignoring all non-relevant extra flags
	    possible on zval type (>=php-5.3)
	  - display op1 properly on FETCH_CONSTANT and
	    INIT_STATIC_METHOD_CALL (>=php 5.4)

2012-08-08  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Fixed a longstanding issue regarding exceptions in the optimizer.
	  The optimizer removed try/catch blocks resulting in exceptions not
	  being caught.

	  This also solves Drupal 7 installation issues when using eAccelerator
	  (tested with Drupal 7.15 and PHP 5.4.5)
	* Update Win32 VC project files
	* Fixed several Win32 compilation issues, thanks @tengattack

2012-08-06  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Fixed memory leaks in restore_hash() and the optimizer
	* Fixed several issues in the optimizer related to result type
	  checking / setting (PHP 5.4 uses op.result_type for both result
	  type and 'result used mask' instead of two seperate values)
	* Fixed displaying of function/method names in the disassembler
	* Fixed handling of fetch ops by the optimizer and the disassembler

2012-07-30  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* Fixed open_basedir issues as reported on the old Trac site
	* Removed key/value store and session handler bits from config.w32
	  and added doc-comment-inclusion. Win32 project files also need
	  updating but i currently don't have a win32 development station
	* Fixed segfault in store_default_property_access_check when
	  compiled with -O2 and removed unused vars
	* Fixed a very stupid bug in restore_class_parent
	* Rewrote the spinlock implementation. This hopefully takes care of
	  deadlock issues reported on the old Trac site.
	* Removed some excessive debug output

2012-07-26  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* fixed compilation of ea_dasm.c against php < 5.4
	* fixed handling of hashes for php < 5.4
	* disabled MM_CHECK by default because it is broken and causes segfaults when
	  shared memory is exhausted (debug builds only).

2012-07-19  Hans Rakers <hans at rakers.org>

	* PHP-5.4 compatibility
	* Fixed a segfault when restoring class doc comments from
	  disk cache
	* Storing doc comments in cache is default now since most
	  frameworks require this (Reflection API).
	* Re-indented all files using astyle and bumped year

2010-07-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Make the error message about creating the cache directory more
	  clear.

2010-07-26  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fix for ticket #432. The optimizer would eliminate the final
	  ZEND_RETURN of an op array if the script ended with a switch
	  statement. Last opcodes ZEND_BRK, ZEND_JMP, ZEND_JMP,
	  ZEND_RETURN. ZEND_BRK gets optimized to a JMP, which is a JMP
	  to RETURN so gets eliminated. Other 2 JMPs get eliminated,
	  RETURN loses all predecessors, and thus gets eliminated aswell,
	  resulting in a crash. Problem ended up being in the handling of
	  the ZEND_BRK to ZEND_JMP optimization. /long story

2010-07-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart@vanbrabant.eu>

	* Changed the way the cache directory is created:
	- The forked process creates the cache dir and makes it world writable
	- The first request creates a subdir with the userid of the process and
	with permissions 700.

	* Comment out an unused function to support compilin with -Werror
	* Add sched.h include to fix a compiler warning

2010-06-03  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fixed compilation against php-5.1. This closes ticket #426.

2010-02-25  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fixed class static variable restore where parent was protected
	  static and child was public static. This would lead to error
	  'Access to undeclared static property' upon restore from cache
	* Added proper handling of class properties during storing in
	  cache. Public/private/protected is properly handled now. Somehow
	  this was a long overdue TODO spotted by running the testsuite.
	  This fixes ticket #408
	* Small fix that solves some issues with lambda (closure)
	  functions. This solves ticket #405

2010-02-24  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fixed double free in eaccelerator_globals_dtor. This closes
	  ticket #404

2010-02-18  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Remove some leftover debug output that broke compilation with
	  php-5.2 and --with-eaccelerator-debug
	* php_check_open_basedir only needs to be called when restoring

2010-02-04  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fixed linking of ZEND_DECLARE_INHERITED_CLASS_DELAYED across
	  bb's in the optimizer. This fixes bug #399

2010-02-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Remove some leftovers from the lock api
	* Now really add the sched_yield command and not only in commented
	  out

2010-02-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Include the resolve path function from php so it is available for
	  older PHP versions as well. Includes that start file:// work now.
	* Enable phar caching: Files in included from a phar file are cached
	  now. The phar archive is used to excute the stat on.
	* Enable check_mtime usage again
	* Use snprintf the right way. See #290
	* Add a call to sched_yield after a failed spinlock to prevent
	  deadlock conditions. This should fix #381 and is a real fix for #340.
	  Instead of using a fake select as yield, a check is added to disable
	  spinlocks on systems that do not have sched_yield.
	* Fix spinlocks on Solaris with Sun Compiler. #325

2010-02-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Fix two compiler warnings

2010-02-01  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* A retab on eaccelerator.c
	* Remove caching based on inodes
	* Reimplement eaccelerator_stat to speed it up: the new ea_stat is
	  almost twice as fast as the old version with inodes. The tests were
	  done on a file that includes 10k empty files.
	* Increment version to 1.0-dev

2010-01-22  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Release 0.9.6-rc2

2010-01-21  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Set op_array->early_binding in a later stage.
	  This fixes ticket #394

2010-01-20  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Some more work on delayed early binding. This fixes
	  ticket #388
	* Some reformatting in ea_dasm.c
	* Win32 VC6 project file updated

2010-01-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Remove obsolete documentation
	* Update year in copyright

2010-01-19  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Implemented ZEND_GOTO
	* Implemented delayed early binding for php-5.3. This
	  solves ticket #146 (Problems with require_once with
	  circular dependencies) for everyone using php-5.3.
	  See http://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=120539866910125&w=2
	  for more info on this.
	* Fixed ticket #386 (Crash using const & php-5.3)
	* Fixed a bunch of other php-5.3 related issues found by
	  using the test suite and all php-5.3 Zend engine tests
	* Win32 project files updated
	* Win32 ZTS fixes

2009-12-23  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Fixed ticket #383 (crash on ZEND_ADD_INTERFACE)
	* check_mtime can now be enabled/disabled through the web
	  interface as requested in ticket #32
	* Shortened some variable names
	* ZEND_JMP_SET support

2009-12-01  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Win32 compilation fixes (compiles in VC++ 2008)
	* Updated VC++ project file to VC++ 2008 format

2009-11-30  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Added a whole bunch of standard functions to
	  opt_result_is_numeric()
	* init allocated memblocks with memset instead of a for loop
	  in reassign_registers()
	* Fix in build_cfg for PHP 5.3 UCLASS znodes. These are
	  handled differently in 5.3 due to namespaces.
	* Some tweaks and additions to ea_dasm.c
	* Some quick and dirty tweaks to dasm.php to sync looks with
	  control.php
	* Fixed ordering of table columns in control.php. This solves
	  ticket #364

2009-11-25  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* Optimizer and general PHP 5.3 fixes
	* Some cleanups

2009-11-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Add the optimizer back

2009-11-11  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

	* open_basedir bypass fixed. Fixes ticket #104
	* Fix for ticket #194
	* Stripped old opcodes from opcode.c and added new ones

2009-07-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>
	
	* Fix two PHP 5.3 bugs
	* Remove the optimizer
	* Remove the user cache functions

2009-05-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart at vanbrabant.eu>

	* Remove code that is only needed for php < 5
	* Rebase to code to minimal PHP 5.1
	* Update support for PHP 5.3
	* Remove have_sched_yield check in config.m4. This is not used
	  anywhere and and causes some compilation errors.
	* Apply patch from ticket [324]

2008-06-20  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * First stab at php 5.3 support. Only fixes the script cache.
          phpMyAdmin seems to work with these changes.
        * Fix user cache stuff

2008-06-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Remove support for all php versions older than php 5.1

2008-06-18  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>
	
        * Add patch from ticket 232: removes an unlock that isn't
	  needed there.

2008-02-12  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>
		
	* Add new opcodes introduced in PHP 5.3

2007-08-20  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

        * Changed crash handler error message format to Apache-style error log
          format as suggested in ticket #217
        * Fixed ticket #274
        * Performance: eliminated a bunch of time() syscalls
        * Performance: eliminated calls to eaccelerator_gc when not build with
          either session, shm or user cache functionality (which are all off
          by default)
        * Disable eaccelerator_list_keys function when not build with either
          session, shm or user cache functionality (which are all off by
          default)
        * Disable 'User Cache' tab in control panel when not build with either
          session, shm or user cache functionality (which are all off by
          default)
        * Added a creation timestamp to each cache object (shm and disk)
        * Added ttl and creation timestamp display to
          eaccelerator_cached_scripts() / control.php
        * Changed some counters in ea_cache_entry from signed to unsigned
          int
        * Renamed some mmCache remnants && fixed typos/language

2007-08-20  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Rewrite the calc_* funtions so they no longer uses the EAG(mem) global.
        * Rewrite the fixup_* functions so they no longer use the EAG(mem) global.
        * Rewrite store_* functions so they no longer use the EAG(mem) global.
        * Add code that checks the shared memory chunks if needed to make sure
          no data was written past the boundary. Change #undef MM_CHECK in mm.c
          to #define MM_CHECK

2007-08-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix an E_NOTICE error in the control panel
        * Improve storing of objects and fix bug #264

2007-08-16  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix a typo in the config file. #269

2007-08-14  Hans Rakers <hans at react.nl>

        * Optimizer fix for #242. PHP-5.2.1 introduces a ZEND_JMP before a
          ZEND_FETCH_CLASS/ZEND_CATCH which the optimizer did not handle
          correctly, resulting in uncaught exceptions. (Thanks to warwickshaw)

2007-05-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Use php_strtok_r instead of strtok_r (Thanks to Daan <daan at parse.nl>)
        * Add fnmatch.c and fnmatch.h and use it on win32 (Thanks to Daan <daan at parse.nl>)
        * Casting of var 'len' to (int) in decode_version() to get rid of an VC++ 6 warning (Thanks to Daan <daan at parse.nl>)

2007-04-21  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Add patch from Nathanael (eaccelerator@polymorpheus.com)

2007-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Apply the patch from #244 which causes heap corruption.

2007-02-15  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Kick out the old filter implementation and use one based on fnmatch,
          this breaks windows support. The plan is to include a bsd licensed
          fnmatch implementation when a platform doesn't provide fnmatch. 
          (read: when windows is being used). Until some steps up to do this 
          or we run into a machine with windows and VC windows support wil be 
          b0rked.
        * Move spinlock stuff into mm.c, no need for an extra file with extra
          indirection.

2007-02-13  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added a function to dump an eaccelerator class entry in debug.c
        * Changed include order in mm.c because of eaccelerator.h include in debug.h 
        * Fixed a nullpointer dereference in some special cases in ea_restore.c:509
        * Always compile a ea_debug_error message in ea_restore.c
        * Cleanup: Removed some commented out code, changed some debug statements,
            reordered some conditional includes to reduce ifdef statements
        * Check if those array indices are set before testing them in control.php
        * Revert some changes form changeset @256 to fix bug #199
        * Some more year updates
        * Fix loading of cached scripts and data on disk
        * Fixed a bug in the zend_class_entry dump debug routine

2007-01-29  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed some obsolete code

2007-01-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Happy new-year

2006-11-08  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Enable disassembler links again in the control panel
        * Add some more isset for E_ALL error reporting

2006-11-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * It seems I'm longer able to do simple comparisons, this 
          should fix #187 and is a real fix for #182

2006-10-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix encoding and decoding of eA and php versions. Only three numbers
          versions were encoded, this way file cache isn't removed when using
          svn snapshots or rc releases.
        * Fix a compile warning when using filename hashing instead of inode 
          hashing.
        * Optimize a part of the inode hashing function.
        * Remove a conditional compile for very old php versions in the filename
          hashing function.
        * Included the new control center written by Thomas Love. It rocks!

2006-10-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Replaced short php opening tags in control.php
        * Fixed typo in NEWS file
        * Fix for ticket #170 (handling of multi-dim globals by the optimizer)

2006-10-10  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix a bug in the ttl of the cache. see ticket #182
        * Release version 0.9.5

2006-09-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Get session config variables from local values instead of global
          values. This enables altering of session-related settings like
          gc_maxlifetime, entropy_file and entropy_length through ini_set().
          This fixes ticket #166

2006-09-18  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed unbalanced ifdef in eaccelerator.h introduced in rev [269].
          This fixes ticket #177

2006-09-15  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Reverse changeset 205 (doc-comment exclusion) from Tom Regner 
          <t.regner at librics.de>. 
        * only put the function that has the same name as the class as contructor 
          if there isn't a __construct function. This fixes ticket #172
        * Don't free memory with efree that has been allocated from the eA shm cache.
          This should fix A LOT of bugreports in Trac and on SF. It fixes #171 but 
          I think also some other bugs.

2006-08-29  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Skip disk cache creation and clean/clear actions when operating in
          shm_only mode. This fixes ticket #165

2006-08-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixes for tickets #157 and #164

2006-08-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix stupid bug (#159)
        * Handle returning null instead of array (#156)

2006-08-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * zend_do_inheritance can't be called with TSRMLS_CC when using 
          php 4, this also means that eAccelerator won't work with threading!
        * ea_info and ea_dasm: if eaccelerator_mm_instance is NULL, just return
          null and don't do something.

2006-07-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Don't use our own hash function, the one from the ZE is extremely much
          faster and provides a much better distribution.
        * Don't compile the user cache code one no feature is being compiled.
        * A big cleanup in struct naming
        * Move some functions around to make more of them static, this reduces
          the binary size and load times.
        * Remove some leftovers from restoring encoded scripts which only create
          overhead without the loader.
        * Clean up the session handler, removed old code for php < 4.3. 
        * Fixed detection of SysV IPC shared memory and made anonymous mmap 
          the first selected type. This makes the behaviour of rc1 the 
          default. anonymous mmap doens't have the problem of shmmax. SysVIPC is 
          still available!
        * Fixed some of the detection test in the configure script that probably
          never worked.

2006-07-29  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Use php realpath directly without wrapper, TSRM implements the realpath cache

2006-07-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Restore the class entry of zend_property_info when using php 5.2, this fixes bug #151

2006-07-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Branched 0.9.5, development for 0.9.6 will start in trunk
        * Bumped up version to 0.9.6-dev
        * Killing the very broken encoder. Once when eAccelerator is in full
          shape an encoder may return.
        * Some fixes to make eAccelerator compile with php 5.2, this fixes bug #150
        * Restore __toString methods correctly with php 5.2
        * Fix bug #145, objects are serialized when they are stored in shared memory.
          Users don't have to do this in their code anymore.
        * Wrong ifdef in compile fix for php 5.2
        * Update config.w32, VC6 and VC2005 project files
        * Fix debug build for win32, this fixes ticket #149
        * Removed a debug statement and added return value in optimizer.c

2006-07-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix restoring of opcode handler for php 5.0.5 when files are loaded
          from disk cache. This fixes bug #147
        * Some update in the release notes for the upcoming rc1
        * Fix loader.c too so we don't get any linking errors. 

2006-07-24  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Make clean routine support dir hashing. Again, this should be tested
          on win32!
        * Use a define for the magic string in the eAccelerator file headers
        * Bump up version to 0.9.5-rc1
        * Put -O2 back on for -rc1
        * Update the VC2005 project files
        * Add a config.w32 file for static building of eAccelerator

2006-07-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>
        * Fix for ticket #47 and #63, related to problems restoring empty
          strings and empty string array keys from the disk cache.

2006-07-23  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix ticket #143, seems that PHP < 5 doesn't make the extension lower 
          case.

2006-07-22  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Some zval macro's differ for php4 and 5, this fixes #146.
        * Also rewrite clean code for cache files on win32 for directory 
          hashing. This hasn't been tested on windows!!!
        * Added a script to create a bugreport file with more information
          about the userenvironment.

2006-07-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Use some more zval macro's to cleanup things a bit
        * Removed the code from mm.c that tried to allocate more then one segment 
          because it didn't work, this part needs a redesign of the mm code to 
          allow this. It should allocate one to init the shared memory and add
          the other to the free list.

2006-07-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Made some fixes to ea_info.c to make eA compile on windows again.
          This should fix bug #116.

2006-06-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Cleaned up the checking for other incompatible extensions a 
          bit. This should fix the use of IonCube with eAccelerator. I did 
          some test loading IonCube in different ways and never got in to 
          trouble. This fixes ticket #66.

2006-06-30  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Added ability to sort table columns by clicking on the table
          headings in the control panel
        * Quick & dirty fix for eaccelerator_clear to work with the new
          cache dir hashing. This still needs to be done for win32.

          eaccelerator_clean still needs some fixing to work with the
          dir hashing.

2006-06-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed ifdef for #108 to use only on windows
        * Fix for bug #109, #31 and SF-1102070
        * Cleaned-up RINIT a bit for hostname determining
        * Included the fix from ticket #94 for zts

2006-06-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix ticket #108
        * Removed webui.[c|h] from the windows project files

2006-06-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for ticket #101 ('bailout' is used in zend_globals.h in a ZTS
          build) as suggested by <ihanick at gmail dot com>

2006-06-02  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Removed two unused vars from the internal datastructures
        * Fixed constructor inheritance. This fixes handling of implicit
          constructors and solves ticket #89

2006-05-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Forgot to remove some debug messages for the filter bug.

2006-05-08  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Make the disassembler do openbasedir checks before showing a file, 
          this fixes bug #59
        * Changed the filter logic a bit, this fixes bug #72

2006-05-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added directory hashing for md5 and inode based keys based on a patch
          from <mattias at efterfesten.com>, default is 2 levels deep.
        * Renamed some left over MM based names to EA.
        * Increased default hash size for user and script to 512 for extra 
          performance.

2006-05-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Don't store the doc_comments in op_array and class_entry. They are 
          useless. this should reduce memory footprint.
        * Included patch from Stadler from ticket #23. It adds a nice menu 
          and code highlighting.

2006-04-13  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * When content cache is used also compiled shared memory functions

2006-04-11  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for 64-bit compilation warnings "cast to pointer from
          integer of different size"

2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A lot of fixes to silence the compile warnings generated when compiling
          with the default Fedora compiler options
        * Removed FC compiled options from Makefile.in again, stupid me 

2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Silenced the unlock function for win32 until a windows developer can
          take a look at it.
        * Updated the README a little more for the new control panel
        * Added release notes for beta2
        * Bumped up version to 0.9.5-beta2
        * Patch for dasm.php form Stadler, see #23
        * Fixed typo in optimizer which broke compilation for PHP != 5.1
        * Released beta2

2006-04-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed some typos in dasm.php
        * Added authentication to the disassembler

2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed handling of interfaces. This fixes sf.net bug #1440575.
          This fix also introduces some changes in the cached object structure
          so remember to empty your disk caches if you have them. This is
          always a good thing to do after upgrading btw :)

2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Reverted the change to the handling of ZEND_BRK made by me on
          2006-03-17 since it wasn't working as it should. Since this
          reintroduces sf.net bug #1442923 i added some code to prevent this
          bug using a different approach, by restoring operand types changed
          by build_cfg if build_cfg exits with exit code 0.

          Since php-5.1 some opcode handlers expect a strict set of operand
          types, anything else results in 'Invalid opcode' errors. Since
          build_cfg changes some operand types these changes need to be
          reverted once the optimizer finishes. For now the only opcode to
          which this all applies is ZEND_FETCH_CONSTANT, which expects
          either a CONST or a UNUSED in op1 and a CONST in op2 (See
          zend_vm_def.h)

2006-04-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed some error introduced by fixing some win32 stuff :(

2006-04-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Moved the FLOCK stuff to a place so it can be used by eLoader to
        * Fixed quite some compile warnings on Win32
        * Updated VC6 project files

2006-03-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed the constant that were registered in the debug code. They 
          could only be used in php code and not in the config file. This 
          handles bug #29

2006-03-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Source code is now shown in dasm.php
        * Added source-code lines to the returned opcode array in ea_dasm.c

2006-03-21  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed bug #24

2006-03-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for sf.net bug #1442839 (handling of ZEND_ASSIGN_OBJ by the
          optimizer)
        * Changed BRK handling to not bail out of the optimizer prematurely
          on a multi-level break. This does need some more testing, but
          should fix sf.net bug #1442923
        * Removed some dead code in ea_store.c and excluded some debug code
          from compilation in optimize.c

2006-03-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Included fcntl.h in ea_info.c, this should fix bug #13

2006-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Set refcount to 1 before storing a zval in the usercache. This fixes
          bug #4.
        * Some formatting cleanups in cache.c
        * In restore_zval the zval length could be something else then 0 when 
          an empty string was set.
        * Removed the shorttags in control.php and dasm.php to fix bug #8.
        * Set the svn keywords property to some files.
        * Moved some function defs from eaccelerator.h to the right files.

2006-03-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed the old webui and made a new controlpanel and disassembler.
        * Added php api documentation

2006-03-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Changed copyright dates to 2006
        * Updated the eaccelerator url in some last files
        * I removed all authors from specific files. Authors can be traced 
          through mmcache and eaccelerator cvs. I did this because some 
          names should be added to quite some source files while others have
          added their own while contributing less then the once not mentoined.
          All contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file and specific 
          information can be found in the Changelog and cvs.

2006-03-01  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Bunch of Win32 fixes. It compiles cleanly now (tested with VC++ 6.0)
        * Fix to the optimizer for bug #1439344
        * Fix to ea_store.c for a build problem on RHEL3 reported on the forums at 
          https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3596327

2006-02-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Changed the module entry url to eaccelerator.net and year
        * Removed the crash function
        * Disable the keys, session and content cache by default. These could 
          result in a local DoS by cache poisioning

2006-02-24  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Release of eaccelerator 0.9.5-beta1

2006-02-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Altered the way debug output is in/excluded by adding a macro that makes
          sure calls to functions like ea_debug_printf don't get compiled in a
          non-debug build. The macro approach was chosen to prevent swamping the
          code with any more ifdef statements. This approach (as opposed to the
          previous empty-function-if-no-debug-build) also makes sure debug function
          arguments such as the tons of getpid()'s (which don't come cheap) don't
          get compiled in and executed in a non-debug build.

2006-02-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Don't increase parent refcount in restore_class_parent. This is wrong
          and leads to trouble in the Zend shutdown phase (zend_destroy_class).
          This most likely also fixes the REMOVE_POINTER_FROM_LIST segfault of
          bug #1432758

2006-02-22  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Workaround for "multiple definitions of symbol" thread-safe build
          problem on OSX. This fixes bug #1407520
        * Renamed mm_mutex to ea_mutex to avoid confusion with eA's memory
          manager. This was probably a leftover of mmCache times.

2006-02-21  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Ditched the variadic macros. They were kinda useless now anyway since
          they were only passing one arg. This should make the Win32 folks happy
          since VC6 doesn't seem to support variadic macros (its a C99 thing)
        * Removed some excessive debug output.

2006-02-20  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed bypassing open_basedir restriction when the file was already 
          cached. This fixes bug #1427719
        * Included patch #1435196 to fix the problem of duplicate keys that 
          don't get removed.

2006-02-20  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed static_members handling for php-5.0. Broke this while
          working on PHP-5.1 support. Lost in ifdef statements ;)
        * Fixed ZE1 (<=PHP4) problem regarding parent class lookup during restore.
          Parent classname wasn't lowercased before lookup in class_table. This
          also fixes bug #1432758 (can't restore parent class "stdClass" of class xyz)

2006-02-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Restored PHP4 compatibility
        * Fixed inheritance/prototype issue with abstract methods and classes during
          restore. zend_do_inheritance handles these properly now.

2006-02-18  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Bumped up version to 0.9.5-dev

2006-02-17  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Merged PHP_5_1 branch with HEAD

2006-02-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Some final fixes before merging to HEAD:
          - Fixed bug #1410723 (handling of class constants by the optimizer)
          - Fixed backwards compatibility with PHP < 5.1
          This revision works pretty well in my testing environment, PHP-5.1 support
          seems to be coming along quite well. Please test with your applications/
          in your environment and report back with your experiences or possible problems!

2006-02-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Released version 0.9.4

2006-02-15  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fixes for five failing tests found using the test suite created by Bart
          Tests that failed where:
          -ctor_dtor_inheritance (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -destructor_and_exceptions (failed because inheritance of parent methods was broken, fixed by making sure ea_store doesn't store methods outside scope)
          -inheritance_002 (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -private_members (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -type_hinting_003 (failed because array_type_hint introduced in zend_arg_info in PHP-5.1 was ignored)

2006-02-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip dot be>

        * PHP_5_1: Changed cflags to -O2 from -O3

2006-02-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * On failure of mm initialisation, return FAILURE
          instead of disabling eAccelerator.

2006-02-08 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The owner of the a sysvipc mutex will now be changed on creation of
          of the mutex. The user will be set to the uid set with 
          --with-eaccelerator-userid. This way the semaphore doesn't need to
          be public writable anymore.
        * Moved some inactive contributors to the inactive list.
        * Aplied patch #142200
        * Fixed typo (patch #1409125)
        * Fixed some typos and cleaned up the README file a bit more
        * Fixed some typos in README.eLoader
        * Updated NEWS and bumped up version to 0.9.4-rc2
        * Released 0.9.4-rc2

2006-02-07  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fix for problems with __autoload
        * PHP_5_1: Fixed compile problems with thread-safe PHP

2006-02-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Quite some major changes, including but probably not limited to:
          -Fixed numerous memory leaks
          -Fixed the handling of empty string variables (as in ""), causing "String is not zero-terminated" warnings when PHP is compiled with --enable-debug
          -More fixes to the handling of static properties (access checking/inheritance)
          -Inheritance on restore is now handled by zend_do_inheritance
          -Fixed handling of ZEND_OP_DATA and ZEND_INIT_METHOD_CALL by the optimizer
          -Cosmetic fixes (spelling etc.)

2006-01-16  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fix for bug #1401474 (and most likely some more php-5.1 related trouble)
          static_members handling was incorrect.

2006-01-12  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * First batch of PHP-5.1 related changes committed to the newly created
          PHP_5_1 branch. This is a work in progress, so YMMV.

2006-01-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix for bug #1366008
        * Fix for bug #1238736, when a log file is set eA will lock it
          before writing to it.

2005-11-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Disabled the cache dir check, to much people complaining
        * fixed eLoader

2005-11-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Some compile fixes from Chmouel Boudjnah

2005-11-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * check_cache_dir is only done when shm_only = 0
        * Only eA is disabled when init of shared mem or cache check fails
        * Released 0.9.4-rc1

2005-11-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed executor hooks, they weren't used anyway.
        * Check if eA has a valid cache directory.
        * Make the init of php fail if the initialisation of the shared memory
          or cache directory failes.
        * set shared memory size in eaccelerator.ini to 0 so the default OS
          size is used.
        * README updates
        * Updated version to 0.9.4-rc1

2005-11-17 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed optimizer bug with php 5.0.5

2005-11-16 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch for including files in same directory (#1259695) from Alexy

2005-11-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Spinlock test now tests for i386 and x86_64. Because spinlocks where
          never used on 64-bit and sysv ipc locking didn't work, there were a 
          lot of problems.

2005-10-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The two error message added to see if a lock has failed made configure 
          fail to compile the shared memory test.

2005-10-13 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed the php5 optimizer bug.
        * Changed semaphore permissions to 0666 so sysvipc locks work. Working 
          locks seem a bit more important than making the semaphore public. (#1295970)
        * Added error messages when a lock can't be aquired or released.

2005-08-03 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Included some compile fixes. (Thanks Matt)
        * Included patch from the hardened php guys to make eA work
          with hardened php.

2005-07-11 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * ea_store.c and ea_restore.c functions clean up
        * extraced restore_class_parent and restore_class_methods from
          restore_class_entry to share code with loader.c
        * extracted opcode handling in encode/decode_op_array into 
          encode/decode_op to make code more readable
        * make decode_class_entry use new functions in ea_restore.c
        * readded line-number encoding
        * bumped up encoder version to 4 until new loader is in place

2005-07-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Renamed some macros from MMC (mmcache) to EA (eg MMCG is now EAG)
        * Added eA file header to mm.c, mm.h and x86-spinlocks.h
        * Readded a hack to the loader to prevent zend2 segfaults

2005-07-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for php4 (bug #1235017)
        * Removed atexit code that only produced segfaults and didn't work
          (Patch from Rob Foehl <rwf at loonybin.net>)
        * Code clean up and compile fixes for VC.net + VC.net project files update
          (Based on patch #1234919)
        * Future check warning was done on uninitialised buf.
        * Some code clean ups and updated VS6 project files.

2005-07-07 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added get_zend_destroy_property_info function to ea_restore.h
        * Code refactoring needed for the new encoder. Moved all store/calc
          functions to ea_store.c and all restore/fixup functions to ea_restore.c

2005-07-06 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for zend engine 1.
        * Documented namespace option
        * New debug/log code. Make the code a lot cleaner and easier
          for the user to debug eaccelerator.

2005-06-27 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed a buffer overflow in eaccelerator.c and cache.c. A string longer
          then 8 bytes was copied in a char array of length 8. This isn't a
          security risk because the overflowed bytes were directly overwritten
          by other values. This fixes bug 1228096 which was caused by the 
          bufferoverflow detection in FC4. 
          http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html

2005-06-24 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The future check is removed because mtime are only checked on changes
          so caching files from the future isn't a problem.

2005-06-23 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Applied patch 1226111
        * Added a warning message when php scripts have a modification time in
          in the future and the debug is enabled.

2005-06-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Set the test value shared memory to 32mb instead of 64mb because the
          test will fail on 2.6 kernels where 32mb is the default value. (#1203253)
        * Reverted the patch for the gc_maxlifetime setting when using
          user functions for the session handler. I can't find a way to
          access the current value instead of the ini setting.
          Using the session api is the preffered session handling way anyway.

2005-05-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Bumped version to 0.9.4-dev
        * Changed hash_mm prototype in eaccelerator.h to non-inline (Compaq c compiler)

          some parts that are forgotten with the code split are fixed. 
          They are also needed to compile eA with VC. The other stuff should make it possible 
          to compile eA as a static module for php.
        * Updated VC project files

2005-05-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch fixing php 5 constructor problems. Fixes bugs 1179264, 1121757 and 1099693
        * Added switch -w to encoder so you can encode file without the check for eloader. This is 
          based on patch 1191147 with some fixes.

2005-04-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The first part of the code refactoring. In this part the monolitic 
          eaccelerator.c file has been split up in more logical blocks.
          - cache.c/cache.h contains the procedure for shm.c/session.c/content.c to add user_cache entries to the ea cache
          - shm.c/shm.h contains the eaccelerator shared memory functions
          - session.c/session.h contains the session related stuff
          - webui.c/webui.h contains all stuff related to the webinterface and disassembler
          - debug.c/debug.h contains some procedures to print debug information
          - content.h contains the php content caching prototype instead of eaccelerator.h
        * Added --without-eaccelerator-shared-memory and  --without-eaccelerator-webui configure switches
        
        Bugfixes included:
        * Patch 1188510 eaccelerator_compile_file typos
        * Patch 1189792 session life time patch
        * Patch 1167069 HAS_ATTRIBUTE fix with FreeBSD 4.x
        * Patch 1166707 loader patch for OOP functions in PHP5
        * Patch 1173095 mm_alloc & mm_free clash with libirc
        * Fix for 1178588, 1153030 and patch 1189852. Fixes the endless loop when reseting a non array.
          The optimisation for that caused this is removed for zend engine 2 and 1 because 
          php >= 4.3.11 is also affected, so this will be useless in some time.

2005-01-14  Shin Seung Woo <segv74 at gmail.com>

        * fixes 1099498 Problems with IMP H3 (Horde) when restarting apache2
