eAccelerator for PHP
=====================

eAccelerator is now a deprecated project and is not maintained anymore. 

If you are thinking of using eAccelerator.... just don't. 

It has several critical bugs which will break your application in ways you do not expect.

-> Use APC instead if you need a modern PHP opcache. <-

Enjoy!
