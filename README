eAccelerator for PHP
=====================

What is eAccelerator?
----------------------
eAccelerator is a free open source PHP accelerator and optimizer for PHP. It
increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in compiled state,
so the overhead of compiling  is  almost completely eliminated. It also
optimizes the scripts to speed up execution.

eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your
PHP code by 1-10 times.

eAccelerator is a fork of TurckMMCache 
( http://sourceforge.net/project/turckmm-cache/  by Dmitry Stogov )

eAccelerator stores compiled PHP scripts in shared memory  and  executes  code
directly from it. It creates  locks  only  for  short  time,  while  searching 
compiled PHP script in the cache, so one script can be executed simultaneously
by several engines. Files that can't fit in shared memory are cached  on  disk
only.

eAccelerator is compatible with Zend Optimizer's loader. Zend  Optimizer  must
be installed after eAccelerator in php.ini. If you don't use  scripts  encoded
with  Zend  Encoder  we  do  not  recommend  to  install  Zend  Optimizer with 
eAccelerator.

eAccelerator does not work in CGI mode but it does work in Fast-CGI mode with
webservers like lighttpd.


Download
--------
Latest eAccelerator versions can be downloaded at the sourceforge page:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/eaccelerator/
Development snapshots from cvs can be downloaded at 
http://snapshots.eaccelerator.net


Requirements
------------
* apache >= 1.3, mod_php >= 5.1 or php with fastcgi support
* autoconf, automake, libtool, m4

Compatibility
-------------
eAccelerator works with php version 5.1 and higher.
It is being used on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows 
with Apache 1.3 and 2, lighttpd and IIS.


Quick install
-------------

You can find more information about the installation of eAccelerator on our
website at http://www.eaccelerator.net/

Note(1): for Microsoft Windows installation, please refer to README.win32 file.

Step 1. Compiling eAccelerator

  export PHP_PREFIX="/usr"
  
  $PHP_PREFIX/bin/phpize
  
  ./configure \
  --enable-eaccelerator=shared \
  --with-php-config=$PHP_PREFIX/bin/php-config
  
  make

  You must specify the real prefix where PHP is installed in the "export"
  command. It may be "/usr" "/usr/local", or something else.

Step 2. Installing eAccelerator

  make install

Step 3. Configuring eAccelerator

eAccelerator can be installed both as Zend or PHP extension.

For eaccelerator > 0.9.1, if you have /etc/php.d directory, you should copy eaccelerator.ini inside and modify default value if you need.

If not, you need to edit your php.ini file (usually /etc/php.ini).

To install as Zend extension:

  zend_extension="/usr/lib/php5/eaccelerator.so"
  eaccelerator.shm_size="16"
  eaccelerator.cache_dir="/tmp/eaccelerator"
  eaccelerator.enable="1"
  eaccelerator.optimizer="1"
  eaccelerator.check_mtime="1"
  eaccelerator.debug="0"
  eaccelerator.filter=""
  eaccelerator.shm_ttl="0"
  eaccelerator.shm_prune_period="0"
  eaccelerator.shm_only="0"

  If you use thread safe build of PHP you must use "zend_extension_ts" instead
  of "zend_extension".

To install as PHP extension:

  extension="eaccelerator.so"
  eaccelerator.shm_size="16"
  eaccelerator.cache_dir="/tmp/eaccelerator"
  eaccelerator.enable="1"
  eaccelerator.optimizer="1"
  eaccelerator.check_mtime="1"
  eaccelerator.debug="0"
  eaccelerator.filter=""
  eaccelerator.shm_ttl="0"
  eaccelerator.shm_prune_period="0"
  eaccelerator.shm_only="0"

Step 4. Creating cache directory

  mkdir /tmp/eaccelerator
  chmod 0777 /tmp/eaccelerator


Configuration Options
---------------------

eaccelerator.shm_size
    The amount of shared memory (in megabytes) that eAccelerator will use.
    "0" means OS default. Default value is "0".

eaccelerator.cache_dir
    The directory that is used for disk cache. eAccelerator stores precompiled
    code, session data, content and user entries  here. The same data  can  be
    stored in shared memory also (for more quick access). Default value is
    "/tmp/eaccelerator".

eaccelerator.enable
    Enables or disables eAccelerator. Should be "1" for enabling  or  "0"  for
    disabling. Default value is "1".

eaccelerator.optimizer
    Enables or disables internal peephole optimizer which may  speed  up  code
    execution. Should be "1" for enabling or "0" for disabling. Default  value
    is "1".

eaccelerator.debug
    Enables or disables debug logging. Should be "1" for enabling or  "0"  for
    disabling. Default value is "0".

eaccelerator.check_mtime
    Enables or disables PHP file modification checking .  Should  be  "1"  for
    enabling or "0" for disabling. You should set it to "1"  if  you  want  to
    recompile PHP files after modification. Default value is "1".

eaccelerator.filter
    Determine which PHP files must be cached. You may specify  the  number  of
    patterns (for example "*.php *.phtml") which specifies to cache or not  to
    cache. If pattern starts with the character "!", it means to ignore  files
    which are matched by the following pattern. Default value is "" that means 
    all PHP scripts will be cached.

eaccelerator.shm_ttl
    When eaccelerator fails to get shared memory for new script it removes all
    scripts which were not accessed  at  last "shm_ttl"  seconds  from  shared
    memory. Default value is "0" that means -  don't  remove  any  files  from
    shared memory.

eaccelerator.shm_prune_period
    When eaccelerator fails to get shared memory for new script  it  tryes  to
    remove  old  script   if   the   previous   try   was   made   more   then
    "shm_prune_period" seconds ago. Default value is "0" that  means  -  don't
    try to remove any files from shared memory.

eaccelerator.shm_only
    Enables or disables caching of compiled scripts on disk. It has  no  effect
    on session data and content caching. Default value is "0" that means -  use
    disk and shared memory for caching.

eaccelerator.allowed_admin_path
    The script paths that are allowed to get admin information and do admin 
    controls

Control panel and disassembler
------------------------------

If you want to use the control-panel you need to compile eAccelerator with 
    --with-eaccelerator-info which is the default value.
You need to copy the control.php file to your webroot and set the path to it 
in the php.ini or eaccelerator.ini in the eaccelerator.allowed_admin_path 
directive. If you don't do this you wont be able to see much information and 
can't control eAccelerator.
You can set the username and password needed to access the control-panel in 
the control.php file. By default the username is administrator and the password
is eAccelerator.

When you compile eAccelerator with --with-eaccelerator-disassembler you need 
to place the dasm.php and PHP_Highlight.php file also in the same directory 
as the control.php file. The disassembler requires PHP to be compiled with
tokenizer support (--enable-tokenizer).
You can set the username and password needed to access the disassembler at the
top of dasm.php.
