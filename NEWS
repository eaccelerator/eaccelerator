 * Release 0.9.6.1
    Fix some PHP 5.3 related issues. Only minor bugs have been fixed.

February 4, 2010 - Bart Vanbrabant
------------------------------

 * Release 0.9.6
    The theme of this release is: back to basics! All non essential functions
    are removed from eAccelerator. This means the keys, content and
    session functions have been removed. There are other (and probably better)
	alternatives for this functionality available by now.

    Changes in this version:
        - Support for PHP 5.3. 
        - The encoder is removed
        - The user cache function are removed
        - The minimal PHP version supported is now 5.1
        - Some internal refactoring to clean the code up
        - Fixed some bugs (and probably added some)

------------------------------
 * Released 0.9.5.3
    An other 0.9.5 maintenance release
    Changes in this version (from 0.9.5.2)
        - Remove an unlock statement that shouldn't be there. This should
          fix the problems reported in #232 and a lot of related bugs. 
          Thanks to Terry Duncan for the fix!

September 03, 2007 - Bart Vanbrabant
------------------------------------
 * Released 0.9.5.2
    Changes in this version (from 0.9.5.1)
        - This release fixes the optimizer bugs with php 5.2 that caused 
          exception handlers to be optimized out. 

May 06, 2007 - Bart Vanbrabant
----------------------------------

 * Released 0.9.5.1
    Changes in this version (from 0.9.5)
        - Fix bug that causes problems with protected attributes and php 5.2
        - Fix ttl bug in list_keys
        Known issues:
            Exceptions aren't catched by try catch due to optimizer bug, see
            bugreport #242.

Oct 11, 2006 - Bart Vanbrabant
----------------------------------

 * Released 0.9.5

    Changes in this version (from 0.9.4):
        - This version brings full php 5.1 and 5.2 support, this has as 
          side-effect that eAccelerator won't work anymore with php 4 on windows,
          on other platforms this isn't a problem.
        - The shared memory functions, session handler and content cache are 
          disabled by default now. They are only used by a small amount of
          users and they could allow local users to fill up the memory, if they
          aren't secured properly.
        - The old web control panel and the disassembler have been removed 
          from the code. They have been replaced with a set of php functions 
          that allow the same functionality to be implemented in a PHP script.
          The control.php and the dasm.php files are such scripts. More 
          information about this can be found in the README.
        - Memory footprint should be reduced because redundant information in
          the cached scripts is no longer stored. Keeping this information 
          cached can be done with --with-eaccelerator-doc-comment-inclusion
        - File hashing in the cache directory to improve performance with a 
          big amount of cache files.
    WARNING: The encoder and loader DO not support php 5.1 nor php 5.0 and contain
    a lot of bug for php 4. This is the last release the encoder/loader 
    functionality will be available. Maybe later a new encoder/loader will be 
    included but there aren't any plans for that.
    As always all patches and help are more then welcome.

 * Released 0.9.5-beta2

    There are some big changes in this beta: 
        - The shared memory functions, session handler and content cache are 
          disabled by default now. They are only used by a small amount of
          users and they could allow local users to fill up the memory, if they
          aren't secured properly.
        - The old web control panel and the disassembler have been removed 
          from the code. They have been replaced with a set of php functions 
          that allow the same functionality to be implemented in a PHP script.
          The control.php and the dasm.php files are such scripts. More 
          information about this can be found in the README.
        - A lot of bugfixes which bring us closer to full PHP 5.1 support.
    This version is already quite stable and some people are already using it
    in production environments. Please test this beta2 as good and as much as
    you can. If you find a bug, report it back to us on the website and if
    possible add a small snippet of code so we can reproduce it.

 * Released 0.9.5-beta1

    The first beta in the history of eAccelerator! This release mainly contains
    support for php 5.1 and some small bugfixes that got fixed along the way.
    This version fully passes the PHP 5.1 test suite so it's time to have a 
    broader public testing the code.
    Most work has been done by Hans Rakers based on patches from Xuefer and 
    Bart. Lyle also contributed some fixes.
    We feel this release is already more stable and better compatible with 
    PHP 5 and 5.1 then the 0.9.4 release. We hope to make a stable release 
    soon. The encoder hasn't received any love so it's still only compatible 
    with PHP 4!. Please report all bug back to us.

----------------------------------

 * Released 0.9.4

    This release only contains some bugfixes and code cleanups. This release
    is still the old codebase. It doesn't contain any new code yet.
    - Some fixed were done to the encoder. The format changed a bit so I bumped
      up the encoder version. Because the encoder still isn't functional for
      php version other than php 4 you should only use this encoder if you want
      to have line numbers encoded.
      In next versions we will try to fix the encoder for php 5 and 5.1
    - eA should be php 5 compatible except some very unusual cases.
    - This version DOESN'T support php 5.1

----------------------------------

 * Released 0.9.4-rc2
